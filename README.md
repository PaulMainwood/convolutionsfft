# convolutionsfft

A small Pluto notebook which convolves arbitrary distributions - initially set to explore delay effects modelled by LogNormal, Gamma and Weibull distributions.
Code "inspired" (= half inched) from Seth Axon's lovely response to a question on Julia Discourse: https://discourse.julialang.org/t/distribution-of-sum-of-random-variables/69023/5
